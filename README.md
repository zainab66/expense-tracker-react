### About this app

This app is a small expense tracker that can be used to add in items with both positive and negative values and this will be reflected with both green/red colour and in the top diplay where a balance is updated dynamically.

I wanted to learn more about simple apps and so followed along a tutorial on YouTube created by Traversy Media (Build an Expense Tracker video) in order to better understand principles of React and how to use functions such as reduce/GlobalState/setContext.

I will aim to update this app with further features of my own and change the layout and design in the future.

## Getting started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
